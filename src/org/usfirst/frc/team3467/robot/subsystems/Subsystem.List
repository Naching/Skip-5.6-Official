Subsystem Lists

Subsystems called by Operator Interface:
	- DriveBase (PIDSubsystem directed by Gyro)
		* Drive
		- CANTalon (left)
			- Quadrature Encoder [CIM Encoder] (left)
		- CANTalon (right)
			- Quadrature Encoder [CIM Encoder] (Right)

    - Intake
        * Ball Control
        - CANTalon (Pull In / Push Out) (X - Direction)
        - CANTalon (Pull In / Push Out) (Z - Direction)
        - Solenoid (Raise / Lower)

    - Utility Bar
        * Get over/under obstacles
        - Solenoid (Raise / Lower)
        - Solenoid (Finger Deploy / Retract)

    - Catapult
        * Shooter
        - CANTalon (to load)
        	-Potentiometer (Angle)
        - Solenoid (to Release)
        

Utility/Sensor Subsystems:
	
	- Gyro
		* Gyroscope
		- MXP IMU
	
	- Brownout
        * Power Management
        - Registration interface for Subsystems
        - Callback vector for subsystem notification
        - Constant monitoring of voltage level
	   
    - Camera
        * Vision Targeting
        * Field Vision
    
    - Compressor
        * Intelligent compressor control
        - Provides a way to turn off compressor during critical moments (e.g. shooter reset)
        - Use inline pressure sensor to make decisions about how long to run, etc.
        
Brownout Management Strategies:

    - Drivebase: Throttle back max speed when battery starts to get low
    - Shooter: Turn off compressor when resetting; don't attempt to reset when power is very low
    - Intake: ???
